Problem Statement

Unfortunately, violence against women has been escalating, creating significant barriers to their equitable growth and prosperity. Women make up over 48% of Pakistan's population, nearly half of the country. However, due to societal conventions and distressing incidents, their participation in various activities is limited compared to men.
Inspiration & Motivation

Our motivation to work towards women's empowerment stems from recognizing their immense potential and contributions. As students, sons, and family members, we are committed to supporting and encouraging women to persevere and succeed. Our aim is to foster a positive and empowering environment for women.

To this end, we developed a mobile application named ‚ÄúWomen Safety App‚Äù - You Deserve to be Safe!

The "Women Safety App" is specifically designed for women, providing them with a reliable means to reach out to their trusted contacts, send alerts, share their location, and more.
üì± Features

The features of the Women Safety App include:

    Get Home Safe: Allows users to track their location at intervals set by themselves.
    Safe Shake: Enables users to send SOS alerts by shaking their device, even if the app is not open.
    Helplines: Provides quick access to nearby police stations, hospitals, fire brigades, pharmacies, and other essential services.

These features are aimed at enhancing women's safety and security.
